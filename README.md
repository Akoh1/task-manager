# task-manager
A web app to manage tasks for technical teams, You can open a workspace for your organizations
 and users can sign up to that workspace, create tasks, assign it milestones, change tasks milestones.
 This web app also provides RESTFUL API which would be consumed by my front-end project which would be implemented by vuejs later on. 

**Technology Used:** Django 2.1.5 (Python 3)

 **Database:** SQLite 3 (SQLite is used because it can be safely assumed that it would not be a very busy site and enterprise level database can be avoided)
